# Distributed File Storage

#### I built this to learn about distributed systems, how they work and tried to put in whatever i have learnt, still working on it to add other features 

A distributed file storage implemented using a custom-built P2P (peer-to-peer) library. 
This project includes features such as data replication, and methods for GET, READ, and WRITE operations on files.

## Features

- **P2P Library**: Custom-built peer-to-peer library for handling network communication and peer management.
- **Data Replication**: Ensures data availability and fault tolerance by replicating files across multiple nodes.
- **GET Method**: Retrieve metadata or status information about the file system or specific files.
- **READ Method**: Read the contents of a specific file from the distributed file system.
- **WRITE Method**: Write data to a specific file in the distributed file system.
